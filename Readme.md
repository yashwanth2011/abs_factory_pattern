Abstract factory design pattern is used in this project to design the flow of manufacturing a 
Sunblock bottle in a MNC which is located in India and America

This MNC offers 3 types of Sunblock bottles to sell. They are:
1) Chemical Sunblock bottles -> In which main ingredient is a chemical.
2) Mineral Sunblock bottles -> In which main ingredient is a Natural substance.
3) Oil Sunblock bottles -> In which main ingredient is an oil.

Depending on the location of order placed, the main ingredient used in the Sunblock bottle varies.

For instance, a chemical sunblock bottle manufactured in America uses Zinc Oxide as main ingredient.
But in India TitaniumOxide is used as main ingredient as ZincOxide is prohibited in India cosmetics.

Also, based on material available at the location main ingredient varies for both the factories.
